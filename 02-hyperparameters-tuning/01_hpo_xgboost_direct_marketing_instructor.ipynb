    "## Background\n",
    "Direct marketing, either through mail, email, phone, etc., is a common tactic to acquire customers.  Because resources and a customer's attention is limited, the goal is to only target the subset of prospects who are likely to engage with a specific offer.  Predicting those potential customers based on readily available information like demographics, past interactions, and environmental factors is a common machine learning problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will train a model which can be used to predict if a customer will enroll for a term deposit at a bank, after one or more phone calls. Hyperparameter tuning will be used in order to try multiple hyperparameter settings and produce the best model.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by specifying:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The S3 bucket and prefix that you want to use for training and model data.  This should be within the same region as SageMaker training.\n",
    "- The IAM role used to give training access to your data. See SageMaker documentation for how to create these."

    "Now that we have prepared the dataset, we are ready to train models. Before we do that, one thing to note is there are algorithm settings which are called \"hyperparameters\" that can dramtically affect the performance of the trained models. For example, XGBoost algorithm has dozens of hyperparameters and we need to pick the right values for those hyperparameters in order to achieve the desired model training results. Since which hyperparameter setting can lead to the best result depends on the dataset as well, it is almost impossible to pick the best hyperparameter setting without searching for it, and a good search algorithm can search for the best hyperparameter setting in an automated and effective way.\n",

    "We will use SageMaker hyperparameter tuning to automate the searching process effectively. Specifically, we specify a range, or a list of possible values in the case of categorical hyperparameters, for each of the hyperparameter that we plan to tune. SageMaker hyperparameter tuning will automatically launch multiple training jobs with different hyperparameter settings, evaluate results of those training jobs based on a predefined \"objective metric\", and select the hyperparameter settings for future attempts based on previous results. For each hyperparameter tuning job, we will give it a budget (max number of training jobs) and it will complete once that many training jobs have been executed.\n",

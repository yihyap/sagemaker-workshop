# Deep Learning Framework

Just like with those frameworks, now you can write your PyTorch script like you normally would and rely on Amazon SageMaker training to handle setting up the distributed training cluster, transferring data, and even hyperparameter tuning. On the inference side, Amazon SageMaker provides a managed, highly available, online endpoint that can be automatically scaled up as needed.

This notebook shows how you can:

- Use SageMaker Deep Learning Framework to deploy Pytorch model
- Bring your own training script and deploy on SageMaker infrastruture

For more information about the PyTorch in SageMaker, please visit [sagemaker-pytorch-containers](https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-pytorch-containers) and [sagemaker-python-sdk](https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-python-sdk) github repositories.
